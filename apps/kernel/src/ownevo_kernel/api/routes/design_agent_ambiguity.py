"""`/api/design-agent/*` — ambiguity-detection endpoints.

Two stateless endpoints:

  * `POST /ambiguity-report` — **post-generation** scan. The web layer
    holds the just-generated WorkflowSpec (and optional MetricDefinition)
    in memory after `POST /api/nl-gen/generate` and posts them back here.
    Returns an `AmbiguityReport` with `workflow_spec_id` set.

  * `POST /description-conflicts` — **pre-generation** scan over the
    raw description, before NL-gen has produced a spec. Used by the
    discovery chat panel to surface contradictions
    ("maximize recall, zero false positives") as additional questions
    before the operator clicks Generate. Returns a bare `findings` list
    (no spec, so no spec_id and no `AmbiguityReport` envelope) — the
    operator's answers are persisted as additional `discovery_transcript`
    entries on the workflow row at generate time.

No DB read, no LLM call. Both passes are deterministic — pure
functions of their inputs — so the endpoints are cheap to call and
trivial to test without a kernel boot.

A future slice extends `/ambiguity-report` with an LLM-judge variant
for cross-artifact conflicts; the endpoint contract stays the same
and clients opt in via a query flag.
